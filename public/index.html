        <h2>What Does This Project Do?</h2>
        <p>The Second Chance Gap Initiative uses empirical research to advance a more just and equitable society by documenting and working to remove the barriers faced by people with criminal records, barriers that disproportionately impact African-American people and communities. [It is a partner of the Clean Slate Initiative, a national bipartisan coalition advancing policies to automatically clear all eligible criminal records across the United States.]</p>
        <p>A staggering number of Americans live with curtailed freedoms due to contact with the criminal justice system: close to 80M - or one in three American adults - has a criminal record. 6M Americans are barred from voting due to a prior felony. 2.3M Americans are incarcerated. The burdens of mass incarceration and criminalization are not evenly distributed: African Americans are 5 times more likely to be incarcerated in state prisons than whites; a substantial share of the variance, studies have independently found, cannot be explained by differences in levels of criminal offending, which themselves can reflect biased decision-making in criminalization.</p>
        <p>Across the country, every state has passed “second chance” legislation to, under certain circumstances, allow Americans to clear their criminal records, get back their right to vote, and shorten their sentences. These “second chances” are intended to lower barriers to full reintegration into society and unlock opportunity for millions of Americans. But our research documents that only a small fraction of those eligible for relief have received it, placing tens of millions of Americans in the “second chance gap.”</p>
        <p>We produce reports and research [internal link] to account for the people and profiles of people stuck in “paper prisons” due to their inability to access second chances and that could get relief through automated approaches like Clean Slate.</p>
        <p>Through our empathy hackathons [internal link], we partner with nonprofits and changemakers to build tools and technology to address second chance gaps and to raise awareness of the barriers that people often face after they’ve served their time, and to further the creative and innovative approaches to building an integrated society they are developing.</p>

        <h2>What Is The Problem To Be Solved?</h2>
        <p>Every time a person is arrested, charged, or convicted of a crime, this event is memorialized in the person’s criminal record, setting off thousands of potential punishments and discriminatory treatments in employment, housing, voting, professional licensing, and civic life. These records and punishments often continue for years even when the underlying activity has been decriminalized, time has been served, or the person was never convicted in the first place. While laws on the books provide second chance relief, deficiencies in their administration mean that only a small fraction have gotten the relief to which they are entitled.</p>
        <p>As a result, tens of millions of Americans, we estimate, are stuck in a paper prison, denied the freedoms enjoyed by persons without records due to old crimes, charges and arrests that were never convicted, and decriminalized activities. Turning the tide on mass incarceration and mass criminalization requires restoring rights - to vote, to not be unfairly judged by an arrest, or to move beyond one’s past conviction - to the one in three adults that lives with a criminal record.</p>
